Apologies for the rudeness that may appear merely or abundantly. The current month, May, is beyond doubt overwhelming for all of us. Besides the submissions, I need to cope up with my 2nd year university coordinator’s lazyness/apathy and complete my registration, visa process in record time. In between all this, I started lifting, thereby limiting the carbs intake. For those unaware, limited carbs -&gt; limited patience. So, things are going to get a lot crazier from my side. This post is a helpless attempt to ask forgiveness for my future behaviour. . The last minute stuff . I’m an anxious guy. I try to avoid it by working early or on time. Unless you’re Julia/Jelena/Nils, I don’t believe in your capabilities to solve things over a weekend. Or I have under-estimated you or I might not have worked with you before to assess. . For Hoder’s sake, RESPOND . If you have work, I understand. Absolutely no problem if you cannot work too. But, Please respond in the group. I’m not asking you out on a dinner date. Just like my last sentence, I may nudge you to respond on a meeting date/time. . Career advice from my limited 2 years of work experience: Regardless of how talented you are, if you are too shy to even respond, the path is going to be tough. .",

Almost as if a huge debt of void from 2020 has been cleared. But in the last two weeks of December, I started worrying too much about the future and completely forgot my beautiful moments. Thanks to my old friend, I happened to narrate my experiences last year and be grateful for it. . Personally and professionally, I undersell myself. Thankfully, it changed this year. My self-confidence went up in personal aspects. All thanks to the people I’ve met. Perhaps, it is in the European culture maybe. . What the future holds . Thinking about the future isn’t that bad after all. I have decided to prioritize learning over fun as that debt has been cleared and I have completed my 1st semester ;). I’m still not sure what I want in life. (Haha, not a great thing to share with the Job Market). And I carry the impostor syndrome despite the amazing feedback I got from all my collaborations. . Anyway, I spoke to few of my ex-colleagues to get a perspective and prioritize my time. Some believe it’s AI for HealthCare (I think so too), some think it’s MLOps but one person thinks it doesn’t matter as long as you as keep learning.

It has been an year since I got my EMLCT Masters Admit with a full-ride scholarship. Due to COVID-19, there was a blanket ban on international travel for the most part. In August 2020, India started allowing students to travel internationally. In my case, I had to travel to Delhi (Country’s capital -&gt; 1500Kms away) without an appointment and get PCC &amp; medical certificates within a short span of 1 month. And this is also the time where India started moving towards its COVID infection peak. To not force myself in these conditions, I gave up and deferred my program to 2021. . Down side of WFH . . Tip: Separate your work-place from bedroom. I continued working with the same company, retiring to a mediocre job. Work during the pandemic was undetachable. Subconciously, my room was mapped to work. I conjecture that this made my mind to not stop thinking about work even at nights, replaying office conversations, code logics, etc. My sleep has deprecated drastically. Avg sleep duration was around 3-4 hours and this had an impact on my health. . Limiting Work to Work . . Tip: Travel when you are feeling low. Brings a lot of fresh perspectives. Travelling looked like a good option for me. It came with 2 benefits. Dissociating self from the room and not obsessing about work. (Since I had to worry about travel strategies, meeting strangers, source of food etc). Within 2 hours of this thought, I travelled to Gokarna. . .

Infact, the time in Gokarna was so great that I drafted a letter to every individual I met. . Taking time to explore . While my initial plan is to postpone resignation until I get the VISA, my co-worker’s resignation nudged me to do the same considering the banality of the work. On May 05th, I put down my papers despite all the uncertainities that lay ahead. I want to use this time to .

Things are not looking great again. India is currently experiencing a 2nd wave what I’d call a shock wave, leaving no family untouched with grief. Countries are restricting travel to/from India. I will have to see how it pans out. In the best case, I’d be studying Computational Linguistics, completing assignments, making presentations and meeting people from different backgrounds. In the worst case, I will have to join the industry again. .",
