            "content": "Well, I thought 2021 just swept through like our very own Minnal Murali or like the Flash. . Figure 1: 2021 in a giffy But the reality is, . I had a lot of fun in 2021. Almost as if a huge debt of void from 2020 has been cleared. But in the last two weeks of December, I started worrying too much about the future and completely forgot my beautiful moments. Thanks to my old friend, I happened to narrate my experiences last year and be grateful for it. . Personally and professionally, I undersell myself. Thankfully, it changed this year. My self-confidence went up in personal aspects. All thanks to the people I’ve met. Perhaps, it is in the European culture maybe. . What the future holds . Thinking about the future isn’t that bad after all. I have decided to prioritize learning over fun as that debt has been cleared and I have completed my 1st semester ;). I’m still not sure what I want in life. (Haha, not a great thing to share with the Job Market). And I carry the impostor syndrome despite the amazing feedback I got from all my collaborations. . Anyway, I spoke to few of my ex-colleagues to get a perspective and prioritize my time. Some believe it’s AI for HealthCare (I think so too), some think it’s MLOps but one person thinks it doesn’t matter as long as you as keep learning. Well, that’s too broad a statement to make but I got the gist. . I will be shuffling between the below topics for this year… . NLP (Computational Linguistics) -&gt; Most of my time -&gt; Syntax, Morphology, Multilingualism, etc. | Software Engineering -&gt; FastAPI, Revisiting Dockers, Git. | System Design -&gt; O’Reilly Book on System Design - If possible | MLOps -&gt; Andrew’s NG course on MLOps | Practical stuff -&gt; Edge Deployment - Over phone, browser. | Tech Blogging, Weekend Hiking. | Cloud -&gt; Check any free Azure/AWS courses and complete them | Learning Spanish and Dutch | Complete atleast 5 telugu novels -&gt; Kanyasulkam, Asamarthuni jeevana yatra &amp; more | Other books -&gt; “Guns, Germs and Steel” &amp; “The Bonobo and the Atheist” &amp; “The Selfish Gene” &amp; “The Rational Optimist”. | I am also inclined towards becoming a consultant. Will keep a track of it. | Motto of 2022 -&gt; “If you don’t ask, the answer is always NO.” | .",

At times, letting readers learn something from it. This post serves two purposes: . Introducing self: Establishing priorities &amp; opinions | Suggesting things which I wouldn’t do otherwise | My quirks . I’m an ambivert. I can party hard and enjoy my solitude as well. | My silence and lack of small talk may discomfort you. Please excuse me. | With all modesty, I don’t get angry. | . What I like / dislike . You can always reach out and suggest/comment on me. I will be open-minded. I learn fast. | I disrespect arrogance. I’ll respect you as a human being and ignore you. | . Communicating with me . Use few words – whether written or spoken. Don’t ramble. I pick up fast. I’ll ask if I don’t understand. | I like conversations. We can talk about something trivial to non-trivial. But definitely not badmouthing people. More in the later sections. | Specifically, I always welcome technical interaction. I may be busy, but please reach out to me. I appreciate it. | I’m a late morning person. Many others are early morning people. So I’m generally free after 10:30am. | I’m very open to new ideas. If I resist, try again after a day or two. I have strong opinions held weakly (i.e. I change them quickly when convinced otherwise.) | . Alcohol . Alcohol is an uninvited and unplanned guest in my life. Since it has been only an year that I started, here are a few things I understood about my relationship with it: . If I’m uncomfortable around the people I’m drinking with, I binge drink to ease myself. . | If I’m comfortable, I would enjoy my time having conversation with you. I would prefer you over alcohol. . | Surprisingly, I met a few people who drink to do things under the disguise of being drunk. Unfortunately, I can detect this bullshit easily. Accept yourself and your wants/needs. Try talking to me when sober. I’m great at pulling off these kind of conversations. Please don’t repeat you’re drunk just after the first drink and every drink that follows. . | Badmouthing . . Tip: Dissociating the political aspects of it, the word bitching usually refers to badmouthing. This aspect alone talks alot about your insecurities and makes a huge difference in our friendship. I regret every second of mine hearing your futile opinion/rant about a 3rd person who’s not in the spot. It will pull you down in others’ eyes. I would prefer solitude over spending time with you. . Quoting Sirivennela Sastry garu, . “శత్రువులు నీకున్న లోపాలే, స్నేహితులు నీకున్న ఇష్టాలే” . This roughly translates to . “All your friends reflect your interests. All your enemies reflect your drawbacks.” . Specifics: The Nuances . I have my drawbacks as well. Infact, a person without drawbacks is an enigma to me. What matters is, “what kind of drawbacks?”. If you are angry with almost everyone around you, you’ve made a living hell around yourself. If the presence of a person is making you angry, you’ve handed over the authority to that person. . Specifics: The Nuances: 3rd Person? . If you’re bitching about a political figure or even a professor’s inefficiency, I am okay with it. I’m not comfortable badmouthing our peers. Outright, NO. . It might seem tough but there are a lot of other things we can talk about. Many trivial things too. Ok, I end this with a caustic sentence : “How pathetic should you be to remember your enemies and feel much worse.” . Willing to accept . I prefer you being completely honest with me. For example, If you think my attire/words don’t think are appropriate, think of it as a suggestion and let me know. If you don’t tell, I would never know and never change. . Finally, . It is only after meeting some wonderful people, my pessimistic attitude on life changed. I cannot risk going back. This post is a selfish attempt to save my positive perspective. . Thanks to my Masters, I’m living in the most beautiful city, thronged with young folks. It feels great to meet a lot of youngsters. While I enjoy the company of my prospective friends, I felt that it can be better. Hence, the post. .",

At times, letting readers learn something from it. This memoir reflects how an uncertain, unexpected calamity affected me in career and mental aspects. . Lockdown, Travel and Masters . It has been an year since I got my EMLCT Masters Admit with a full-ride scholarship. Due to COVID-19, there was a blanket ban on international travel for the most part. In August 2020, India started allowing students to travel internationally. In my case, I had to travel to Delhi (Country’s capital -&gt; 1500Kms away) without an appointment and get PCC &amp; medical certificates within a short span of 1 month. And this is also the time where India started moving towards its COVID infection peak. To not force myself in these conditions, I gave up and deferred my program to 2021. . Down side of WFH . . Tip: Separate your work-place from bedroom. I continued working with the same company, retiring to a mediocre job. Work during the pandemic was undetachable. Subconciously, my room was mapped to work. I conjecture that this made my mind to not stop thinking about work even at nights, replaying office conversations, code logics, etc. My sleep has deprecated drastically. Avg sleep duration was around 3-4 hours and this had an impact on my health. . Limiting Work to Work . . Tip: Travel when you are feeling low. Brings a lot of fresh perspectives. Travelling looked like a good option for me. It came with 2 benefits. Dissociating self from the room and not obsessing about work. (Since I had to worry about travel strategies, meeting strangers, source of food etc). Within 2 hours of this thought, I travelled to Gokarna. . . Note: This was in December, when cases are decreasing. Time in Gokarna was great. Work was simply reduced to a routine that pays to lead a life. Infact, the time in Gokarna was so great that I drafted a letter to every individual I met. . Taking time to explore . While my initial plan is to postpone resignation until I get the VISA, my co-worker’s resignation nudged me to do the same considering the banality of the work. On May 05th, I put down my papers despite all the uncertainities that lay ahead. I want to use this time to . Try out an alternate source of income - Teaching, Freelancing | Revise fundamentals for Masters | Contribute to Open-Source. | Practice Writing everyday. | Practice Piano | The Present . Things are not looking great again. India is currently experiencing a 2nd wave what I’d call a shock wave, leaving no family untouched with grief. Countries are restricting travel to/from India. I will have to see how it pans out. In the best case, I’d be studying Computational Linguistics, completing assignments, making presentations and meeting people from different backgrounds. In the worst case, I will have to join the industry again. .",
