Almost as if a huge debt of void from 2020 has been cleared. But in the last two weeks of December, I started worrying too much about the future and completely forgot my beautiful moments. Thanks to my old friend, I happened to narrate my experiences last year and be grateful for it. . Personally and professionally, I undersell myself. Thankfully, it changed this year. My self-confidence went up in personal aspects. All thanks to the people I’ve met. Perhaps, it is in the European culture maybe. . What the future holds . Thinking about the future isn’t that bad after all. I have decided to prioritize learning over fun as that debt has been cleared and I have completed my 1st semester ;). I’m still not sure what I want in life. (Haha, not a great thing to share with the Job Market). And I carry the impostor syndrome despite the amazing feedback I got from all my collaborations. . Anyway, I spoke to few of my ex-colleagues to get a perspective and prioritize my time. Some believe it’s AI for HealthCare (I think so too), some think it’s MLOps but one person thinks it doesn’t matter as long as you as keep learning. Well, that’s too broad a statement to make but I got the gist. . I will be shuffling between the below topics for this year… .

It has been an year since I got my EMLCT Masters Admit with a full-ride scholarship. Due to COVID-19, there was a blanket ban on international travel for the most part. In August 2020, India started allowing students to travel internationally. In my case, I had to travel to Delhi (Country’s capital -&gt; 1500Kms away) without an appointment and get PCC &amp; medical certificates within a short span of 1 month. And this is also the time where India started moving towards its COVID infection peak. To not force myself in these conditions, I gave up and deferred my program to 2021. . Down side of WFH . . Tip: Separate your work-place from bedroom. I continued working with the same company, retiring to a mediocre job. Work during the pandemic was undetachable. Subconciously, my room was mapped to work. I conjecture that this made my mind to not stop thinking about work even at nights, replaying office conversations, code logics, etc. My sleep has deprecated drastically. Avg sleep duration was around 3-4 hours and this had an impact on my health. . Limiting Work to Work . . Tip: Travel when you are feeling low. Brings a lot of fresh perspectives. Travelling looked like a good option for me. It came with 2 benefits. Dissociating self from the room and not obsessing about work. (Since I had to worry about travel strategies, meeting strangers, source of food etc). Within 2 hours of this thought, I travelled to Gokarna. . . Note: This was in December, when cases are decreasing. Time in Gokarna was great. Work was simply reduced to a routine that pays to lead a life. Infact, the time in Gokarna was so great that I drafted a letter to every individual I met. . Taking time to explore . While my initial plan is to postpone resignation until I get the VISA, my co-worker’s resignation nudged me to do the same considering the banality of the work. On May 05th, I put down my papers despite all the uncertainities that lay ahead. I want to use this time to . Try out an alternate source of income - Teaching, Freelancing | Revise fundamentals for Masters | Contribute to Open-Source. | Practice Writing everyday. | Practice Piano | The Present . Things are not looking great again. India is currently experiencing a 2nd wave what I’d call a shock wave, leaving no family untouched with grief. Countries are restricting travel to/from India. I will have to see how it pans out. In the best case, I’d be studying Computational Linguistics, completing assignments, making presentations and meeting people from different backgrounds. In the worst case, I will have to join the industry again. .",
