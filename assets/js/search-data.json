At times, letting readers learn something from it. With an almost heavy heart, I write this article to say goodbye to my dear ones in Donosti. And ofcourse to the dearest Donosti as a city. . ## . Whatever the EU folks might have experienced/felt, I can promise that my learning curve is much bigger than others. . For analogy, let’s assume that we’re all 6-year-olds. Remember the time when we’ve passionately played football so-much-so that we were greasy &amp; bruised. We were given a good bath, followed by combing the hair and applying Yardley’s on the cute butter-like cheeks, home to the most-innocent smiles. . I’m the same greasy-bruisy kid who came to Donosti and the city did its magic on me. . To HAP/LAP students . While I could continue on how Donosti changed me, I can’t risk sounding Narcisstic. And I want to share what I feel about you guys. I will go in the order of people I interacted more/ I like more. . Nils . Nils -&gt; So, Nils &amp; my other LCT folks (Julia, Jelena, Anar &amp; Ruan), we came as a group. For some reason, this thing alone, makes me feel closer to them. Anyway, on my very first day, I met Julia and Nils in Gros. Later, we went to see his flat and were discussing how to find a flat. Me being a c ore pessimist in the beginning started complaining how tough it is to find a room without speaking Spanish. Julia, being the most empathetic person, immediately turned to Nils and said “Maybe, we should go with him for house-hounting.?”. To my surprise (SHOCK), Nils had a stonecold expression, almost inherently saying “That’s not my problem”. So, my first impression lived up to the stereotypes of Germans. . I re-asserted myself saying “You’re an adult now. You don’t need assistance in all aspects of life.”. Even while facing racist comments, I didn’t turn to any of them for help. But one day, because of a really racist action (not just comment), I had a breakdown originating from helpless anger on how can my skin color or country decide my character. At that point, I just knew two people in the city. I wanted to share it with someone. Definitely not with stone-hearted Nils (haha), plus his girlfriend is in town. . Anyway, a month later, I locked myself out of the room. I had no option but to take help from Nils. Lot of instances like these. . On Dec 18th, I agreed for a hike with him in Orio but the night before that, I was robbed. I couldn’t convey him that I was robbed and cannot come to the hike. Obviously, he was pissed and did the hike alone. He offered me some cash since I’m robbed. I declined but I really liked that he kept nudging me to take it. It might seem a normal thing to do, trust me I have seen folks who just kept a straight face and said “ok”. So, that act of kindness and help from Nils, moved me. There’s that. . A month later, we were drinking on a Thursday (I mean all Thursdays) but this time just the both of us. . The pizza potes organized by Nils reminded me of a family member nudging everyone to join for dinner. It just felt good to see LCT folks together. . Jelena . Hands down, game guide. .",

Apologies for the rudeness that may appear merely or abundantly. The current month, May, is beyond doubt overwhelming for all of us. Besides the submissions, I need to cope up with my 2nd year university coordinator’s lazyness/apathy and complete my registration, visa process in record time. In between all this, I started lifting, thereby limiting the carbs intake. For those unaware, limited carbs -&gt; limited patience. So, things are going to get a lot crazier from my side. This post is a helpless attempt to ask forgiveness for my future behaviour. . The last minute stuff . I’m an anxious guy. I try to avoid it by working early or on time. Unless you’re Julia/Jelena/Nils, I’m not comfortable believing that we can solve things over a weekend. Or I have under-estimated you or I might not have worked with you before to assess. . Don’t take my previous statement to heart. It is not made w.r.t just one aspect but multiple aspects of a project like coding/latex/writing/thinking, etc. . The deciding factor . The only decided factor is what works best for the project. . For Joder’s sake, RESPOND . If you have work, I understand. Absolutely no problem if you cannot work too. But, please respond in the group. Replying after 3-4 days is futile. I’m not asking you out on a dinner date to feel bad when you say No. Just like my last sentence, I may get pushy to make you respond to a meeting date/time. . I think this helps you in your work life too. Regardless of how talented you are, if you are too shy to even respond, the path is going to be tough in Industry. . That’s it.

Almost as if a huge debt of void from 2020 has been cleared. But in the last two weeks of December, I started worrying too much about the future and completely forgot my beautiful moments. Thanks to my old friend, I happened to narrate my experiences last year and be grateful for it. . Personally and professionally, I undersell myself. Thankfully, it changed this year. My self-confidence went up in personal aspects. All thanks to the people I’ve met. Perhaps, it is in the European culture maybe. . What the future holds . Thinking about the future isn’t that bad after all. I have decided to prioritize learning over fun as that debt has been cleared and I have completed my 1st semester ;). I’m still not sure what I want in life. (Haha, not a great thing to share with the Job Market). And I carry the impostor syndrome despite the amazing feedback I got from all my collaborations. . Anyway, I spoke to few of my ex-colleagues to get a perspective and prioritize my time. Some believe it’s AI for HealthCare (I think so too), some think it’s MLOps but one person thinks it doesn’t matter as long as you as keep learning.

It has been an year since I got my EMLCT Masters Admit with a full-ride scholarship. Due to COVID-19, there was a blanket ban on international travel for the most part. In August 2020, India started allowing students to travel internationally. In my case, I had to travel to Delhi (Country’s capital -&gt; 1500Kms away) without an appointment and get PCC &amp; medical certificates within a short span of 1 month. And this is also the time where India started moving towards its COVID infection peak. To not force myself in these conditions, I gave up and deferred my program to 2021. . Down side of WFH . . Tip: Separate your work-place from bedroom. I continued working with the same company, retiring to a mediocre job. Work during the pandemic was undetachable. Subconciously, my room was mapped to work. I conjecture that this made my mind to not stop thinking about work even at nights, replaying office conversations, code logics, etc. My sleep has deprecated drastically. Avg sleep duration was around 3-4 hours and this had an impact on my health. . Limiting Work to Work . . Tip: Travel when you are feeling low. Brings a lot of fresh perspectives. Travelling looked like a good option for me. It came with 2 benefits. Dissociating self from the room and not obsessing about work. (Since I had to worry about travel strategies, meeting strangers, source of food etc). Within 2 hours of this thought, I travelled to Gokarna. . . Note: This was in December, when cases are decreasing. Time in Gokarna was great. Work was simply reduced to a routine that pays to lead a life. Infact, the time in Gokarna was so great that I drafted a letter to every individual I met. . Taking time to explore . While my initial plan is to postpone resignation until I get the VISA, my co-worker’s resignation nudged me to do the same considering the banality of the work. On May 05th, I put down my papers despite all the uncertainities that lay ahead. I want to use this time to . Try out an alternate source of income - Teaching, Freelancing | Revise fundamentals for Masters | Contribute to Open-Source. | Practice Writing everyday. | Practice Piano | The Present . Things are not looking great again. India is currently experiencing a 2nd wave what I’d call a shock wave, leaving no family untouched with grief. Countries are restricting travel to/from India. I will have to see how it pans out. In the best case, I’d be studying Computational Linguistics, completing assignments, making presentations and meeting people from different backgrounds. In the worst case, I will have to join the industry again. .",
